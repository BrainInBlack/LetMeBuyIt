# LetMeBuyIt

Since Blizzard decided that we're not intelligent enough to figure out what we should buy at a merchant for any given class, they introduced a class/spec based filter for all vendors.

This addon basically reverts this behaviour and defaults the filter for all merchants to 'All' Filter, i.e. everything that the vendor is offering is visible and the player can chose if filter if he/she likes to.
